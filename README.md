# TRACKWORLD APP (Tracking certain real-world phenomena around the world)

PLATFORM: ANDROID/IOS (CROSS-PLATFORM)

TOOLS: TKINTER(PYTHON) AND OTHER PYTHON LIBRARIES AND CERTAIN APIs

LANGUAGE: PYTHON

# ABSTRACT

In this period of continuous developments around the world, sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of important things. So, in order to keep track of important international news around us, keeping track of the current price of crypto coins and others we propose to build an app upon it in Python. The main features of the app are-

(a)Important news around the world

(b)Current price of crypto coins

(c)Sending bulk sms to individuals

(d)Tracking the current location of the phone

# APP FRAMEWORK:

This app is built in Python using a special GUI app development framework called Tkinter. In order to implement the above-mentioned features, we are using certain API servers and accessing those into our program using API keys. The other Python packages used in this app are-

(1) Requests

(2)Datetime

(3)Socket

(4)Geocoder

(5)Json

# FEATURE DEVELOPMENT IN THE APP:

(A)Important news around the world

For the development of this feature, we use the Python package request along with a NEWS API. After generating the API key we extract the news with the help of a request from the API server and display it in the app.
